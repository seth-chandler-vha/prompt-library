## EMG/NCS Documentation

### Standard EMG Report Generation
Generate a comprehensive EMG/NCS report with the following structure:
- Patient demographics and clinical indication
- Technical parameters (temperature, stimulator settings)
- Nerve conduction study results with normal values
- Needle EMG findings by muscle group
- Interpretation and clinical correlation
- Recommendations for treatment/follow-up

Variables to provide: [Patient info, indication, specific findings]

### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Assessment
Create an EMG/NCS interpretation for suspected carpal tunnel syndrome including:
- Median nerve sensory and motor latencies
- Comparison with ulnar nerve studies
- Severity grading (mild/moderate/severe)
- Treatment recommendations based on severity

### Radiculopathy Evaluation Template
Generate systematic evaluation for suspected cervical/lumbar radiculopathy:
- Paraspinal muscle examination
- Myotomal distribution analysis
- Differentiation from plexopathy or peripheral neuropathy
- Correlation with imaging findings

## Brain Injury Medicine

### TBI Assessment Framework
Provide comprehensive traumatic brain injury assessment including:
- Injury severity classification
- Cognitive domain evaluation
- Functional status assessment
- Treatment plan development
- Family education points

### Post-Concussion Syndrome Protocol
Generate management plan for post-concussion syndrome addressing:
- Symptom inventory and tracking
- Return to work/duty considerations
- Cognitive rehabilitation strategies
- Medication management
- Interdisciplinary care coordination

## Spasticity Management

### Comprehensive Spasticity Assessment
Generate comprehensive spasticity evaluation including:
- Modified Ashworth Scale scoring by muscle group
- Functional impact assessment (ADLs, mobility, positioning)
- Pain assessment related to spasticity
- Current treatment regimen and response
- Goals of care and treatment priorities
- Contraindications screening

### Treatment Plan Development
Create individualized spasticity management plan addressing:
- Pharmacological interventions:
  * Oral medications (baclofen, tizanidine, etc.) with dosing
  * Intrathecal baclofen therapy candidacy
  * Botulinum toxin injection planning with target muscles
- Non-pharmacological approaches:
  * Physical therapy modalities and stretching programs
  * Orthotics and positioning strategies
  * Serial casting considerations
- Monitoring parameters and follow-up schedule
- Outcome measures to track effectiveness

### Botulinum Toxin Injection Documentation
Generate botulinum toxin procedure documentation including:
- Pre-injection assessment:
  * Modified Ashworth scores for target muscles
  * Functional limitations being addressed
  * Previous injection history and response
- Injection details:
  * Specific muscles injected with anatomical landmarks
  * Dosage per muscle (units) and total dose
  * Guidance technique (EMG, ultrasound, anatomic)
  * Dilution used
- Post-injection instructions:
  * Activity restrictions and duration
  * Expected timeline for effect (3-7 days onset, 3-4 months duration)
  * Warning signs requiring follow-up
  * Physical therapy coordination
  * Follow-up appointment timing (typically 4-6 weeks)

### Intrathecal Baclofen Evaluation
Assess candidacy for intrathecal baclofen therapy:
- Patient selection criteria:
  * Severity and distribution of spasticity
  * Inadequate response to oral medications
  * Functional goals appropriate for ITB
  * Cognitive ability to manage pump system
  * Social support and follow-up reliability
- Screening trial protocol and interpretation
- Expected benefits and realistic outcomes
- Risks and complications discussion
- Long-term management requirements
- Referral coordination with neurosurgery

## Patient Communication

### Results Explanation Template
Convert technical EMG/NCS findings into patient-friendly language:
- Avoid medical jargon
- Use analogies for nerve function
- Explain what findings mean for daily activities
- Clear next steps and expectations

### Consult Letter Generation
Create professional consultation letter to referring provider:
- Chief complaint and clinical question
- Pertinent history and examination
- Test results and interpretation
- Recommendations with evidence basis
- Timeline for follow-up

## Evidence-Based Medicine

### Literature Search Protocol
Search current medical literature for:
- Specific clinical question in PICO format
- Latest guidelines and systematic reviews
- VA-specific protocols and resources
- Evidence quality assessment

### Clinical Guideline Synthesis
Summarize clinical practice guidelines for:
- Key recommendations
- Evidence levels
- VA implementation considerations
- Changes from previous versions

## Custom Instructions for Clinical Space

```
You are assisting a board-certified Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation 
physician with subspecialty in Brain Injury Medicine, currently serving 
as Deputy Chief of Staff at Montana VA Health Care System.

When handling clinical prompts:
1. Prioritize evidence-based practice and current VA clinical guidelines
2. Consider both patient safety and regulatory compliance
3. Use precise medical terminology in documentation
4. Translate complex findings into patient-friendly language when requested
5. Reference VA-specific protocols and resources when available
6. Maintain HIPAA compliance - never request or include actual patient data

For EMG/NCS queries:
- Use standard nomenclature and measurement units
- Include normal reference values
- Consider clinical context in interpretation
- Provide grading/severity classifications

For Brain Injury Medicine:
- Apply Department of Defense/VA TBI screening criteria
- Reference VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines
- Consider polytrauma and comorbidities common in veteran population

For Spasticity Management:
- Use Modified Ashworth Scale for standardized assessment
- Consider functional goals and patient priorities
- Reference evidence-based treatment algorithms
- Document botulinum toxin dosing and technique clearly
- Screen for contraindications before interventions
