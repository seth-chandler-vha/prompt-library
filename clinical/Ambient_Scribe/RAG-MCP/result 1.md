PALLIATIVE CARE CONSULTATION NOTE
----------------------------------------------------------------
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a \PATIENT AGE\ year old \PATIENT SEX\ here for palliative care
consultation regarding dyspnea, pain, fatigue, constipation, and goals of
care.

HPI:
Veteran (Air Force, 1970s). COPD x15 years. Stage IV lung cancer diagnosed
~8 months ago with bilateral lung involvement and metastases to liver.
Received 6 rounds of chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed); minimal
response; cancer now growing again. Severe shortness of breath with minimal
exertion (needs to stop after 20–30 feet). Continuous oxygen at 4 L/min;
occasionally increases to 6 L/min during distress. Back pain usually 6–7/10
and right rib pain 4–5/10; Tylenol and tramadol provide partial relief.
Constipation: bowel movements once or twice per week; hard stools; no
current regimen. Appetite poor with early satiety. Weight loss ~30 lb over
4 months (from 180 lb to 150 lb). Sleep fragmented due to dyspnea, night
sweats, and discomfort. Mood low; reduced interest in former activities.
Denies suicidal ideation. Lives with wife of 51 years who assists with
care; three adult children live nearby and visit regularly.

Patient goals: prioritize comfort and quality time with family; hopes to
reach Christmas and, if possible, attend granddaughter’s wedding in April.
Prefers to avoid burdensome treatments and hospital death; would rather
remain at home if disease progresses.

ALLERGIES:

ASSESSMENT:
1) Stage IV lung cancer with progression after carboplatin/pemetrexed.
   Patient leaning toward comfort-focused care rather than more chemo or
   immunotherapy due to limited expected benefit and prior toxicity.

2) Dyspnea due to advanced lung cancer and COPD. Severe exertional symptoms
   despite inhalers and continuous oxygen.

3) Cancer-related and musculoskeletal pain (lower back; right ribs). Current
   analgesics provide partial relief.

4) Constipation, multifactorial; no current bowel regimen.

5) Poor appetite and significant weight loss over 4 months.

6) Fatigue with insomnia fragments (dyspnea, discomfort).

7) Psychosocial: low mood; anxiety with breathlessness; strong family
   support; concern about being a burden.

8) Goals of care and advance planning: prefers home-based comfort care; no
   CPR; no breathing machine; no feeding tube; avoid hospitalization for
   progressive lung failure.

PLAN:
Symptom Management:
- Pain and dyspnea:
  - Start morphine 15 mg every 4 hours scheduled.
  - Provide short-acting morphine dose for breakthrough pain/dyspnea.
  - Continue tiotropium and albuterol as prescribed.
  - Continue home oxygen at 4 L/min; patient may increase to 6 L/min during
    distress; reinforce safe use.
- Anxiety related to air hunger:
  - Add low-dose lorazepam as needed for anxiety/shortness of breath.
- Constipation:
  - Start daily stool softener plus stimulant laxative; take routinely with
    opioids.
- Energy conservation and ADLs:
  - PT/OT for pacing and breathing techniques.
  - Provide shower chair and handheld showerhead; teach activity pacing.
- Sleep:
  - Address nocturnal dyspnea via above measures; reassess next visit.

Advance Care Planning / Goals of Care:
- Decision-making capacity: intact.
- Medical Power of Attorney: wife designated previously.
- Code status: Do Not Resuscitate; no intubation/ventilator.
- Treatment limits: no feeding tubes; prefer home care; avoid hospital if
  decline due to progressive lung failure without a reversible cause.
- Documentation: provide and complete updated advance directive; share with
  care teams and family.

Hospice:
- Arrange hospice information visit this week; no commitment required.
- Hospice to provide symptom management, equipment, medications, caregiver
